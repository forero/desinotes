**[desi-general 181] DESI Workshop: November 2-5 2015 at Argonne**

The primary topic of the workshop is end-to-end data flow, from
targets to large-scale structure catalogs.  The workshop is intended
to further our preparation for the various upcoming data challenges
and to advance LSS analysis of mock catalogs.  We will have small
groups working on a federation of related items, with the goal of
making substantial (and documented) progress toward each:

* Definition of targeting inputs to mock data simulations
* Realistic simulations of the survey observation sequence
* Construction of the QuickZ simulation module
* Advancing the LSS catalog generation code
* Construction of module to generate random catalogs
* Assessment of data model for final LSS catalog, which will define the
interface to clustering analysis codes
* One or two TBD items specific to the Lyman-alpha WG

Presentations will be kept to a minimum, and we anticipate most of
the work will occur in small groups, with occasional full-group
reporting.
